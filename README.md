# Crop-Recommendation-Disease-Classification

## Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è
This project is a Proof of Concept (POC), and the data used comes with no guarantee from the creator. Do not use it for making farming decisions. The creator is not responsible for any consequences. This project aims to demonstrate the integration of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) into precision farming.

## Motivation üí™
Farming significantly influences a country's economic growth, especially in countries like India, where a majority of the population depends on agriculture for their livelihood. This project leverages technologies such as ML and DL to make farming more efficient, providing applications for crop recommendation, fertilizer recommendation, and plant disease prediction.

## Applications

### Crop Recommendation
The Crop Recommendation application allows users to input soil data, and based on the analysis, the system predicts the most suitable crop for cultivation.

### Fertilizer Recommendation
With the Fertilizer Recommendation application, users input soil data and the type of crop they are growing. The system then recommends improvements in the soil by identifying deficiencies or excesses.

### Plant Disease Prediction
The Plant Disease Prediction application takes an image of a diseased plant leaf as input. The system predicts the disease, provides background information, and suggests potential cures.

# Built with üõ†Ô∏è

- Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Git, Flask

Libraries:
- Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow for Deep Learning

## How to Use üíª

### Crop Recommendation System

1. Enter the corresponding nutrient values of your soil, state, and city.
2. Note: N-P-K (Nitrogen-Phosphorous-Potassium) values should be entered as a ratio. [Learn more](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/garden-how-to/soil-fertilizers/fertilizer-numbers-npk.htm).

### Fertilizer Suggestion System

1. Enter the nutrient contents of your soil and the crop you want to grow.
2. The algorithm will suggest which nutrient the soil has excess of or lacks and provide fertilizer recommendations.

### Disease Detection System

1. Upload an image of a leaf from your plant.
2. The algorithm will identify the crop type and determine whether the plant is diseased or healthy.
3. If diseased, receive information about the disease cause and suggestions on prevention or cure.
