# Crop-Recommendation-Disease-Classification

## Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è
This project is a Proof of Concept (POC), and the data used comes with no guarantee from the creator. Do not use it for making farming decisions. The creator is not responsible for any consequences. This project aims to demonstrate the integration of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) into precision farming.

## Motivation üí™
Farming significantly influences a country's economic growth, especially in countries like India, where a majority of the population depends on agriculture for their livelihood. This project leverages technologies such as ML and DL to make farming more efficient, providing applications for crop recommendation, fertilizer recommendation, and plant disease prediction.

## Applications

### Crop Recommendation
The Crop Recommendation application allows users to input soil data, and based on the analysis, the system predicts the most suitable crop for cultivation.

### Fertilizer Recommendation
With the Fertilizer Recommendation application, users input soil data and the type of crop they are growing. The system then recommends improvements in the soil by identifying deficiencies or excesses.

### Plant Disease Prediction
The Plant Disease Prediction application takes an image of a diseased plant leaf as input. The system predicts the disease, provides background information, and suggests potential cures.
